# Memory Location and Address

## Introduction:
   Hello guys! At the end of this blog you can understand what is data and how it is stored in the computer and how do you access the data in the storage using address. This article will cover memory location and address from a basic term to the clear understanding. Letâ€™s get start with the basic.
## Memory location and Address:
T  he electronic parts of a computer that store data for processing are referred to as memory in this context. User input, intermediate computations, program instructions, and final outputs are examples of this type of data. A computer system's memory is crucial to its operation because it allows the CPU (Central Processing Unit) to access and modify data fast.
Memory is commonly divided into two categories: secondary memory, which includes hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and other types of memory, and primary memory, also referred to as main memory or RAM. 

## 1. RAM, or primary memory :
This is the memory that the CPU can access directly. Because it is volatile, when the power is cut off, its contents are lost. RAM is used to store instructions and data that are currently being processed by the Central Processing Unit. Although more expensive than secondary memory, it is also significantly faster. In contemporary computers, RAM is commonly expressed in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB).
Secondary Recollection: Because it is non-volatile, this kind of memory keeps its information even when the power is switched off. Long-term data, software, and file storage is done in secondary memory. Hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), optical drives (such as CD-ROMs and DVDs), and flash drives are among the gadgets that fall under this category. Secondary memory costs less and has more storage capabilities than primary memory, although being slower than the latter.
## Addresses and Locations in Memory:
Each byte in the memory of the computer has a distinct address. The CPU uses these addresses to find and access particular data or stored instructions. A single byte of data can normally be stored at each memory location, and the CPU can read from or write to any point in memory by providing its address.
Hexadecimal notation: It is used to represent memory addresses, and they normally range from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF, depending on the architecture and memory capacity of the machine. If the system employs a 32-bit address space, the address 0x00000000, for instance, might correspond to the first byte of memory, and 0xFFFFFFFF to the last byte and is unable to access memory used by other apps. This memory protection technique maintains system stability and aids in preventing unwanted access.
The CPU uses the corresponding addresses to get data and instructions from memory when a program is being run. The memory management unit (MMU) of the computer controls these addresses, making ensuring that every program operating on the system has its own separate address space and and is unable to access memory used by other apps. This memory protection technique maintains system stability and aids in preventing unwanted access.


In conclusion, a computer system's memory is the electronic part that saves data for processing. Memory locations are distinct addresses that are utilized to get access to particular computer memory bytes. The memory management unit is in charge of these addresses, which are necessary for the CPU to get and modify data while a program is running.
